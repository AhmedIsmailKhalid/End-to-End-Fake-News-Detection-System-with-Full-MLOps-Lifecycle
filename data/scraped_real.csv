toggle caption Leo Correa/AP

The war between Israel and Iran began its ninth day Saturday as the two countries continued to trade missile attacks, and Iran's foreign minister warned against the U.S. getting actively involved.

Iran says Israel struck four cities overnight, including Isfahan, where a nuclear site was hit. Iranian authorities said there was no leak of hazardous materials, according to the country's state media. The Israeli military confirmed it targeted centrifuge production facilities there, as part of its attempts to destroy Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iranian media also said Israeli strikes killed five members of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.

The fighting came after Iranian officials had engaged in diplomatic meetings in Geneva, New York and Istanbul on Friday, which failed to produce any breakthroughs, even as President Trump considers whether to join Israel in launching an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.

Speaking Saturday in Istanbul, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned against any active U.S. military involvement in the conflict. ""I think that it would be very, very dangerous for everyone,"" he said.

On Friday in Geneva, Araghchi told his French, German and British counterparts that he was open to further discussions but would not negotiate with the United States while Israel continued to attack Iran.

Meanwhile, the human toll of the conflict continued to rise.

Iran's Health Ministry now reports 430 civilians have been killed and more than 3,000 injured since the Israeli strikes began on June 13, according to Iranian state media. But an independent group called the Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has counted 722 total fatalities in Iran, including nearly 200 military personnel killed, based on nongovernmental sources.

Iranian strikes have killed 24 people and injured more than 1,000 in Israel since the start of Iran's retaliation, according to the Israeli Prime Minister's Office.

Iranian missiles hit Israel's port city of Haifa on Friday, according to the Israeli military. It said there was no major damage from further strikes fired at Israel Saturday.

After announcing Thursday he would decide ""within two weeks"" whether to strike Iran, President Trump on Friday emphasized that ""two weeks would be a maximum.""

Meanwhile, officials from member countries of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation have been meeting in Istanbul and discussing the conflict and the potential fallout from a widening war.

"The math behind the war: Can Israel's air defense keep up against Iranian attacks?. The math behind the war: Can Israel's air defense keep up against Iranian attacks?

As the war between Israel and Iran enters its second week, there's a specific kind of math that will determine just how much longer it can go — how many long-range missiles Iran has versus how many missile interceptors Israel has to shoot them down.

Over the course of several days, Iran launched more than 400 missiles and hundreds of drones in retaliation for Israel's surprise strikes last week, according to the Israeli military. Israel has managed to shoot most of them down — although several have hit — but as the barrages from Iran continue, Israel is using interceptors faster than it can make them.

Sponsor Message

""Whenever you're talking about somebody shooting big ballistic missiles at you, you pay real close attention to the clock in terms of how long you can shoot back,"" says Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Karako says his biggest worry right now is that, eventually, Israel's missile interceptors could run out: ""That would be a bad day. That would be a very bad situation.""

Israeli officials won't comment on how many interceptors it has left, as that would potentially give Iran much-coveted information to gain an advantage. The Israeli military told NPR it ""is prepared and ready to handle any scenario,"" when asked about its extended ability to intercept long-range missiles.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has nodded to key U.S. air defense assistance, both with THAAD missile defense systems and U.S. naval power from the sea, but experts say that as the war continues, Israel will get to a point where it needs to start rationing its arsenal.

""The longer this war drags on, Israel will be put in a position where it has to choose what to defend,"" says Joe Truzman, a senior analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank that often advocates for Israeli security and is critical of Iran.

Sponsor Message

He says Israel might have to start focusing on defending key military or security targets versus civilian infrastructure, for example, meaning that Israeli cities and towns might start seeing more destruction than they have in the last year-plus with wars on multiple fronts.

That, Truzman says, is what Iran wants.

""I think it's in Iran's calculus that it wants to reach that point so it can pressure Israel more to give up on its ambition of destroying Iran's nuclear infrastructure,"" he says.

The other side of the equation is how many long-range missiles Iran has to shoot, and what it has to shoot them with. Few reliable estimates of Iran's stockpile exist, but experts tend to think that Iran has used around a third to a half of what it has since it began firing at Israel more than 14-months ago. Israel also says it has taken out several munitions caches in recent days.

Perhaps more important is how many missile launchers Iran has, which have been a key target for Israeli strikes.

""We attack the launchers,"" Netanyahu said in an interview on Thursday. ""It doesn't matter how many missiles they have, it matters how many launchers they have. And we're getting there, I think we've passed half.""

That's another difficult number to know for sure, but Fabian Hinz, a missiles expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin, tells NPR that, like most nations, Iran has fewer missile launchers than they do missiles, so their destruction is ""definitely an issue"" for Iranian forces as they plan salvos towards Israel.

Israel also claims to control all of Iran's skies, after crippling Iran's air defense, meaning that unlike Iran, it can now strike whatever targets it wants at will. In an interview with Fox News earlier in the week, Netanyahu described it as a ""free highway to Tehran"" for Israel.

Sponsor Message

That could also significantly help the U.S. military should President Trump decide to directly enter the conflict, using massive bunker-buster bombs in an attempt to stop Iran's nuclear capabilities. Earlier this week, the White House said that President Trump will make that decision within two weeks.

Meanwhile, as arsenals on both sides deplete, civilians continue to pay a heavy price. Some 430 civilians have been killed by Israeli strikes in Iran, according to Iranian state media citing the Health Ministry, and more than 3,500 injured, with anxiety high as hundreds of thousands attempt to flee major cities. Israeli officials say 24 people have been killed in Iranian strikes in Israel, and more than 1,000 wounded.

"Trump is no stranger to setting 2-week deadlines. Here's how others have played out. Trump is no stranger to setting 2-week deadlines. Here's how others have played out

toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Trump said Thursday that he will decide whether the U.S. will take military action in the growing Israel-Iran conflict ""within two weeks.""

It's a timeline he's used many times before, dating back to his first term.

Over the years, Trump has promised action on policy issues from tax legislation to minimum wage increases to health care within two weeks. He's hinted at conspiracy theories to be resolved and policy decisions to be revealed within a fortnight — only for his announcements to materialize months later or not at all.

Sponsor Message

Trump has used the timeframe several times in recent weeks alone, priming reporters for updates that have yet to materialize on geopolitical conflicts and global tariffs.

Take Russia's war in Ukraine. In his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly promised he could end the war in one day — but it has since stretched into its third year. Over the last two months, Trump has said repeatedly that various answers to questions about the war, including U.S. assistance to Ukraine, would be just two weeks away.

On April 24, he told a reporter who asked about continued military assistance for Ukraine: ""You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see."" He gave a similar answer days later when asked if he trusted Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he had publicly criticized in recent months.

Those weeks came and went. And on May 19, when asked if Ukraine was doing enough to support U.S.-led cease-fire negotiations, Trump replied, ""I'd rather tell you in about two weeks from now because I can't say yes or no.""

Over a month ago, on May 28, Trump gave Putin another two-week deadline when a reporter asked whether he believed the Russian leader truly wants the war to end.

""I can't tell you that, but I'll let you know within two weeks,"" Trump said. ""We're going to find out whether or not he's tapping us along or not. And if he is, we'll respond a bit differently, but it will take about a week and a half, two weeks.""

On Thursday, after Trump postponed his decision on Iran strikes, a reporter in the briefing room pointed out the pattern of delayed two-week deadlines and asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt ""how we can be sure that he's going to stick to this one.""

Sponsor Message

Leavitt acknowledged the deadlines but said the fighting in Ukraine and the Middle East ""are two very different, complicated global conflicts"" that Trump inherited from the previous administration and has spent ""a tremendous amount of time and effort cleaning up.""

Meanwhile, the world has also been waiting on Trump's decisions about tariffs on most U.S. trading partners — which he unveiled in April before abruptly pausing many of them to allow for negotiations, with a deadline of July 9.

Trump told reporters on May 5 that he would make a determination about pharmaceutical tariff rates ""in the next two weeks,"" though he didn't comment publicly on the topic again until earlier this week, when he said tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be coming ""very soon.""

And he said on June 12 that he would notify trading partners about unilateral tariff rates within — you guessed it.

""We're going to be sending letters out in about a week and a half, two weeks, to countries, telling them what the deal is,"" Trump said.

It's been a pattern since at least 2017

Jen Psaki, a former White House press secretary for President Joe Biden, called the two-week deadline ""one of Donald Trump's absolute favorite tactics"" in her MSNBC show on Thursday.

""And most of the time, in fact almost every time, when two weeks rolls around, Trump has either completely forgotten about whatever it was he promised in the first place, or … he's hoping people have just moved on,"" Psaki said.

Here's how some of Trump's other two-week deadlines have played out over the years:

Tax plan

On Feb. 9, 2017, Trump said a ""phenomenal"" tax plan would be announced ""over the next two or three weeks.""

His administration unveiled its massive tax overhaul over two months later on April 26, and Trump signed it into law after Congress passed it in late December.

Trump has since promised to extend those tax cuts — the majority of which are due to expire at the end of 2025 — through a bill that passed the House in late May and is under close scrutiny in the Senate.

Paris Agreement

During his first presidential campaign, Trump said he would remove the U.S. from the climate accord. And after he took office, he said at an April 2017 rally that he would decide its fate during the following two weeks.

Sponsor Message

On June 1 of that year, he announced that the U.S. would withdraw — which, under the terms of the agreement, didn't take effect until early November 2020.

One of Biden's first acts after taking office in 2021 was to re-enroll the U.S. in the agreement, a move Trump reversed by executive order at the start of his second term.

Health care

The first Trump administration unsuccessfully tried to end the Affordable Care Act, even asking the Supreme Court to overturn it in late 2020. (It rejected the lawsuit in 2021.)

Trump told Fox News in July 2020 that he would be replacing Obamacare and ""signing a health care plan within two weeks,"" which did not happen.

According to the health policy nonprofit KFF, while Trump did propose the idea of an Affordable Care Act replacement in his 2020 budget, it didn't get much attention. And when Trump was asked about his Obamacare replacement plan at a September debate during the 2024 presidential campaign, he infamously replied that he had ""concepts of a plan.""

Infrastructure

As president-elect in 2016, Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure spending program — which took years to become a reality.

He told CBS News on May 1, 2017 that his administration's infrastructure plan would be coming in ""the next two or three weeks, maybe sooner.""

But he didn't unveil the $1.5 trillion plan until February 2018, after a series of false starts that turned ""Infrastructure Week"" into a long-running beltway joke.

While Trump and Democrats tentatively reached an agreement in the spring of 2019, the bill ultimately failed due to disagreements over how to fund it and a number of competing crises, from Trump's impeachment to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Conspiracy theories

More than once, Trump has said that evidence to back up his various claims would appear in exactly a fortnight.

In March 2017, after baselessly alleging that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped his Trump Tower phone ahead of the 2016 election, Trump told Fox News: ""I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.""

Sponsor Message

Within days, congressional leaders from both parties said there was no evidence to support Trump's claim. Years later, in a 2019 Fox interview, Trump admitted he had made the accusations based only on ""a little bit of a hunch.""

Separately, days after losing the 2020 election to Biden, Trump alleged election fraud, and immediately challenged the results in several key states. He told the Washington Examiner that he expected to succeed in ""probably two weeks, three weeks."" Numerous lawsuits, investigations and audits — including ones led by Republicans — found no evidence of the widespread fraud that Trump alleged.",0,NPR,2025-06-21T14:34:56.880443
